# tic-tac-toe

This project is part of <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe">The Odin Project curriculum.</a>
In this project I utilized simple algorithms, MVC design pattern, and Javascript to create both a 2 player game and a randomized computer game.
